            <p>Formed back in 1998 by Danny Sardi and Rich Claudio and ex-members, Edefstry is a band that drives a heavy force into your mind with the will to cause insanity.  From brutal screams of torture and music of pain and anger switched unexpectedly to beautiful melodies with occassional twists of creepy, strange harmonies and then blends into sick, low tuned breakdowns guaranteed to make you want to bash your head into a wall.  This band is the musical equivalent to a mood swing.
                With a variety of musical tastes, it is of no wonder that this band has such a sound different from most other bands out there.   This band of members aging 15, 18, and 20 only tend to get better and better by the day.   From a clash of musical styles and tastes, to the talent at such young ages to make this style of unique music,  they are guaranteed to make peoples heads turn with amazement.
